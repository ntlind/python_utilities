## Purpose

This module contains my most commonly-used python functions, split into various submodules:
    - `io`: saving and loading pandas DataFrames, dask DataFrames, and dicts
    - `dataframes`: filtering, transforming, and compressing pandas and dask dataframes
    - `timeseries`: datetime-specific functions for handling  with time-series data
    - `helpers`: various utility functions, including is_ checks and OS shortcuts
    - `testing`: sample dataframes and profilers that I use in testing

I also use this repo to review CI/CD best practices with my team, including automated testing using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and badging as a forcing function.
